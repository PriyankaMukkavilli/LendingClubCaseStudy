## General Information
- Explore how consumer and loan attributes influence loan default for a consumer finance company. Mitigate the risks associated with loan approval decisions: the risk of losing business by not approving loans from likely repayers and the risk of financial loss from defaulters. Utilize EDA techniques to identify patterns and key variables indicating default, enhancing portfolio management, and minimizing credit loss. The goal is to leverage risk analytics to make informed lending decisions, reduce credit loss, and improve overall risk assessment.
- The dataset contains information about loans issued between 2007 and 2011. Each entry includes details such as loan amount, term, interest rate, borrower's employment, home ownership, and loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, etc.)


## Conclusions
- Risk Mitigation Strategies: Implement targeted risk mitigation strategies for loans with higher risk factors, such as those associated with small business, longer loan terms, and specific employment lengths.
- Portfolio Diversification: Diversify the loan portfolio to reduce concentration risk. This can involve spreading loans across different purposes, grades, and terms to ensure a more balanced and resilient portfolio.
- Credit Scoring Enhancement: Enhance the credit scoring model to better incorporate identified driver variables, such as purpose, grade, and employment length, ensuring a more accurate assessment of borrower risk.
- Targeted Marketing and Education: Conduct targeted marketing and educational campaigns for borrowers in higher-risk categories. This can include providing resources on financial literacy and responsible borrowing practices.
- Continuous Monitoring: Implement a robust system for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio. Regularly update risk assessments based on changing market conditions, economic indicators, and borrower behavior.
- Customer Support and Assistance: Provide proactive customer support and assistance to borrowers facing financial challenges. Establishing a communication channel can help address issues before they escalate.
